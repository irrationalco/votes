# Votes

Create predictive model for election results w/db of historical vote records, polls and other significant predictors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Have R or RStudio installed

### Data

* Mine for local (ie Diputado Federal, Alcalde & Governador) for 2009 records-onwards. Note states may hold elections at different periods.
* Each state is responsible for keeping track of its own local-election records. Eg, for Coahuila one would have to consult http://www.iec.org.mx/v1/index.php/estadisticas
* Data is mostly crap - inconsisntent municipal codes/names, party names, etc. Open Refine is a good alternative software to R or Python text mining tools. But mostly: use intuition, criteria and keep your happy pills handy.
* Redistristaciones/reseccionaciones (altering the region associated with each electoral levels) happen every so often. So it's ok (actually expected) if codes differ each year for secciones/distritos.

### Coding style

* All column names in caps

### Coalitions

Eg with a coalition made up of PRI, PAN & PRD

When non-aggregated to the propietary party
```
COA_PRI_PAN_PRD = Coalition between PRI, PAN & PRD
```

When aggregated to PRI as the propietary party
```
PRI = Sum of the votes of PRI, PAN & PRD
```

Important: The above aggregations **should** be documented in-code to keep track of these transformations.

### Independent candidates

Note these are most relevant in the 2018 elections. Should not be modelled the same as pre-2017 elections.
```
eg. IND2_GOB_17 = Independent candidate for 2017 governor elections
```
### Non-registered candidates
```
eg. NREG_GOB_17 = Non registered votes for 2017 governor elections
```
