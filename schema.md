# Schema

## Coalitions

Eg with a coalition made up of PRI, PAN & PRD

* When non-aggregated to the propietary party
```
COA_PRI_PAN_PRD = Coalition between PRI, PAN & PRD
```

* When aggregated to PRI as the propietary party
```
PRI = Sum of the votes of PRI, PAN & PRD
```

## Independent

Note these are most relevant in the 2018 elections. Should not be modelled the same as pre-2017 elections.
```
eg. IND2_GOB_17 = Independent candidate for 2017 governor elections
```

## Non-registered candidates

```
eg. NREG_GOB_17 = Non registered votes for 2017 governor elections
```
